Hand tracking and recording demo using [mediapipe](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/guide).

[Try it](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/m3at/tiny_projects/blob/main/20250131-js-track-hand-landmarks/index_minified.html)  ← doesn't seem to work fully on some browsers, sorry ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  
You can download the single html page and open it locally, or [try it here instead](https://tmpdemo1.paulw.tokyo/) (I might not keep that up forever)

Allows to track then download the positions of a few selected keypoints, recording multiple tracks at once.
