Small javascript demo of a 2D robotic arm, with inverse kinematics and PID joint control, made with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/).

[Try it](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/m3at/tiny_projects/blob/main/20250130-js-robot-arm/index_minified.html)  ← doesn't seem to work fully on some browsers, sorry ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  
You can download the single html page and open it locally instead.
