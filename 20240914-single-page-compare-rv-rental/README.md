A ~95% LLM generated webpage, to compare camping car rental options. [Try it](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/m3at/tiny_projects/blob/main/20240914-single-page-compare-rv-rental/index_minified.html)

Made with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, took about 20min and 4 iterations. Only tiny fixes were needed. Requested to use html, vanilla js and tailwind. Reasonable interactivity, and it saves the state in local storage.
I generated the css with tailwind, then minified with [minify-html](https://github.com/wilsonzlin/minify-html).

I didn't really need this "tool", and yes that was a distraction from finding what I was supposed to find; but it's fun!
