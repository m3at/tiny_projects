A ~95% LLM generated webpage, to compare camping car rental options.

Made with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, took about 20min and 4 iterations. Only tiny fixes were needed.
Requested to use html, vanilla js and tailwind. Reasonable interactivity, and it saves the state in local storage.

I didn't really need this "tool", and yes that was a distraction from finding what I was supposed to find; but it's fun!
